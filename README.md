#Introduction:
My name is Ryan Lee, and I'm not entirely of the direction I intend to take with my career.
I'm currently more focused on what my education has in store for me rather than trying to bend it to fit a mold.
I already have a functioning knowledge of C++, and it's already making a marginal difference in my progress in the bootcamp as opposed to if I never had it.
