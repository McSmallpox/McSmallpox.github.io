# Introduction:
My name is Ryan Lee, and I'm not entirely of the direction I intend to take with my career.
I'm currently more focused on what my education has in store for me rather than trying to bend it to fit a mold.
I already have a functioning knowledge of C++, and it's already making a marginal difference in my progress in the bootcamp as opposed to if I never had it.

# Passion Project
* Once in high school, two of my best friends and I endeavored to create a card game akin to Yu-Gi-Oh and Magic: the Gathering, both of which we were all obsessed with at the time.
We each had unqiue jobs working on the project, mine mostly being the lore behind the game and game balancing. We put a stop to the project early due to differences in design philosophy, but
we did learn quite a bit about the intricacies of game design.

# Quantitative Attainments
* Academic Achievement award in High School for 3.0 gpa.
* Built up a $1200 net savings in 9 months.
* Can type ~70 words a minute.

# Qualitative Attainments
* Creative - Beneficial at times, but prone to daydreaming.
* Trustworthy - Truthful and loyal, sometimes to a fault.
* Confident in my own abilities - Confident, but sometimes end up losing the scope of my abilities.

# Golden Circle
* Why: Enjoyable and fulfilling career.
* How: Do well in my cohort.
* What: Practical skills gained from Java/Android bootcamp.

# Identity
* The identity I'd want to portray is one of a person who actually knew what they were doing.
